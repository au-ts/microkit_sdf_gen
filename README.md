# Higher-level tooling for constructing seL4 Microkit systems

This repository currently holds various programs to help with automating the
process of creating seL4 Microkit systems.

## Problem

In order to remain simple, the seL4 Microkit (intentionally) does not provide one-size-fits-all
abstractions for creating systems where the information about the design of the system flows into
the actual code of the system.

A concrete example of this might be say some code that needs to know how many clients it needs to
serve. This obviously depends on the system designer, and could easily be something that changes
for different configurations of the same system. The Microkit SDF offers no way to pass down this
kind of information. For the example described, an easy 'solution' would be to pass some kind of
compile-time parameter (e.g a #define in C) for the number of clients. However imagine now you
have the same system with two configurations, with two clients and one with three, this requires
two separate SDF files even though they are very similar systems and the code remains identical
expect for the compile-time parameter. This problem ultimately hampers experimentation.

Another 'problem' with SDF is that is verbose and descriptive. I say 'problem' as the verbosity of it
makes it an ideal source of truth for the design of the system and hides minimal information as to the
capability distribution and access policy of a system. But the negative of this is that it does not scale
well, even small changes to a large SDF file are difficult to make and ensure are correct.

## Solution(s)

* Allow for users to easily auto-generate SDF programmatically using a tool called `sdfgen`.
* Create a graphical user-interface to visually display and produce/maintain the design of a Microkit system.
  This graphical user-interface will sort of act as a 'frontend' for the `sdfgen` tool.

Both of these solutions are very much in a work-in-progress state.

## Developing

All the tooling is currently written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) with bindings
for other languages available.

### Dependencies

There are two dependencies:

* Zig (`0.14.0-dev.2079+ba2d00663` or higher)
  * See https://ziglang.org/download/, until 0.14.0 is released we rely on a master version of Zig.
    Once 0.14.0 is released (most likely in a couple of months) we can pin to that release.
* Device Tree Compiler (dtc)

### Tests

To test the Zig and C bindings, you can run:
```sh
zig build test
```

### Zig bindings

The source code for the sdfgen tooling is written in Zig, and so we simply expose a module called
`sdf` in `build.zig`.

To build and run an example of the Zig bindings being used run:
```sh
zig build zig_example -- --example webserver --board qemu_virt_aarch64
```

The source code is in `examples/examples.zig`.

To see all the options run:
```sh
zig build zig_example -- --help
```

### C bindings

```sh
zig build c
```

The library will be at `zig-out/lib/csdfgen`.

The source code for the bindings is in `src/c/`.

To run an example C program that uses the bindings, run:
```sh
zig build c_example
```

The source code for the example is in `examples/examples.c`.

### Python bindings

The Python package is supported for versions 3.9 to 3.13.
Linux (x86-64) and macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon) are supported. Windows is *not* supported.

The Python bindings are all in Python itself, and do direct FFI to the C bindings via
[ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).

#### Building the package

To build a usable Python package run the following:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/python3 -m pip install .
```

Now you should be able to import and use the bindings:
```sh
./venv/bin/python3
>>> import sdfgen
>>> help(sdfgen)
```

#### Publishing Python packages

Binary releases of the Python package (known as 'wheels' in the Python universe) are published to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sdfgen/).

Unlike most Python packages, ours is a bit more complicated because:
1. We depend on an external C library.
2. We are building that external C library via Zig and not a regular C compiler.

These have some consequences, mainly that the regular `setup.py` has a custom
`build_extension` function that calls out to Zig. It calls out to `zig build c`
using the correct output library name/path that the Python packaging
wants to use.

This means that you *must* use Zig to build the Python package from source.

##### Supported versions

We try to support all versions of Python people would want to use, within reason.

Right now, that means CPython 3.9 is the lowest version available. If there is a
missing Python package target (OS, architecture, or version), please open an issue.

##### CI

For the CI, we use [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/) to automate the process of building
for various architectures/operating systems.

The CI runs on every commit and produces GitHub action artefacts that contain all the wheels (`*.whl`).

For any new tags to the repository, the CI also uploads a new version of the package to PyPI automatically.
Note that each tag should have a new version in the `VERSION` file at the root of the source. See
[scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for doing this.

The publishing job works by authenticating the repository's GitHub workflow with the package on PyPI, there
are no tokens etc stored on GitHub.
